Consider using a Google Voice number or secondary number instead of your personal phone number. Never share your number in your public profile."}},
{"@type":"Question","name":"What should I do if a date makes me feel unsafe?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Trust your instincts. Excuse yourself to the restroom and text a friend or call for a ride. Many bars and restaurants have Ask for Angela programs where you can discreetly ask staff for help.

Never send money to someone you have not met in person."}},
{"@type":"Question","name":"Should I share my last name before meeting?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. Keep your last name private until you have met in person and feel comfortable. Your last name can be used to find your home address, workplace, social media, and other personal information. Use only your first name on dating apps and during initial conversations."}}

<h1>Online Dating Safety Tips Everyone Should Know</h1>

<p style="color:#999;font-size:14px">Published February 27, 2026 &bull; 14 min read &bull; by <a href="https://monkey.singles/">MonkeySingles</a></p>

<p>Online dating connects millions of people every year, but it also creates opportunities for scammers, catfishers, and predators. The vast majority of people on dating apps are genuine, but the small percentage who are not can cause serious financial, emotional, and physical harm. Knowing how to protect yourself does not mean being paranoid. It means being smart.</p>

<p>These safety tips are not hypothetical. They come from real incidents reported to the FTC, FBI, and dating safety organizations. Americans lost over $1.3 billion to romance scams in recent years, and the number continues to climb. Many of these losses were entirely preventable with basic safety awareness.</p>

<p>Whether you are new to dating apps or have been using them for years, this guide covers everything you need to know to protect yourself online and in person.</p>

<h2 id="profile-safety">1. Profile Safety: What to Share and What to Hide</h2>

<p>Your dating profile is public to every user on the platform. Treat it like a storefront window: show enough to attract the right people, but do not display your valuables. The information you share on your profile can be used to find you, stalk you, or steal your identity.</p>

<h3>What to Include</h3>
<ul>
  <li>First name only (never your last name)</li>
  <li>General location (city or neighborhood, not your exact address)</li>
  <li>Recent photos that accurately represent your appearance</li>
  <li>Interests and hobbies that give conversation starters</li>
  <li>What you are looking for (casual, serious, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>What to Leave Out</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Your last name, workplace, or employer name</li>
  <li>Your home address or specific neighborhood</li>
  <li>Photos with identifiable landmarks near your home</li>
  <li>Your phone number in your bio</li>
  <li>Your daily schedule or routine</li>
  <li>Financial information or indicators of wealth</li>
  <li>Photos of your children</li>
</ul>

<p>Review your profile from a stranger's perspective. Could someone use the information there to find where you live, where you work, or show up uninvited? If yes, remove those details.</p>

<h2 id="photo-verification">2. Photo Verification and Reverse Image Search</h2>

<p>Photo verification features on dating apps have become more sophisticated in 2026. Hinge, Bumble, and Tinder all offer some form of photo verification that confirms a person's photos match their actual appearance. Always prioritize profiles that have completed verification.</p>

<p>You can also verify someone independently by reverse-searching their photos. Right-click or long-press any image and search with Google Images, Google Lens, or TinEye. If their photos appear on stock image sites, different social media profiles with different names, or modeling websites, you are likely dealing with a catfish.</p>

<p>Red flags with photos include all photos looking professionally shot, no candid or casual photos, photos that seem to be from different time periods or different people, and photos where the face is always partially hidden.</p>

<h2 id="spotting-catfish">3. How to Spot Catfishers and Fake Profiles</h2>

<p>Catfishers create fake profiles using stolen photos to deceive people into emotional or financial relationships. Here are the warning signs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>They refuse to video chat.</strong> This is the biggest red flag. Real people will agree to a quick video call within the first week of messaging. Catfishers will always have an excuse.</li>
  <li><strong>Their story has inconsistencies.</strong> They forget details they told you, contradict themselves, or become vague when asked specific questions.</li>
  <li><strong>They escalate emotionally too fast.</strong> Declarations of love within days or weeks are a manipulation tactic called love bombing.</li>
  <li><strong>They always have an excuse for not meeting.</strong> Travel, work emergencies, family crises that conveniently prevent any in-person contact.</li>
  <li><strong>They ask for money.</strong> Any request for money, no matter how small or justified it seems, is a scam. Full stop.</li>
  <li><strong>They want to move to a different platform quickly.</strong> Scammers push you off dating apps to messaging apps where their behavior cannot be reported.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="romance-scams">4. Romance Scams: Red Flags and Common Tactics</h2>

<p>Romance scams are sophisticated, long-term cons where a scammer builds an emotional relationship to extract money. The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center receives tens of thousands of romance scam reports annually.</p>

<h3>Common Romance Scam Profiles</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Military personnel stationed overseas:</strong> Claims to be a soldier who cannot access their bank account or needs money for leave.</li>
  <li><strong>Successful businessperson abroad:</strong> Claims to be on a work trip and needs emergency funds.</li>
  <li><strong>Crypto investor:</strong> Introduces you to a "guaranteed" crypto investment platform (pig butchering scam).</li>
  <li><strong>Medical emergency:</strong> Suddenly needs money for a surgery, family member's treatment, or hospital bills.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Core Rule</h3>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Never send money to someone you have not met in person.</strong> No exceptions. No matter how compelling the story, how real the connection feels, or how small the amount. Legitimate romantic interests do not ask strangers for money.
</div>

<h2 id="video-calls">5. Why Video Calls Before Meeting Are Essential</h2>

<p>A video call is the single most effective safety tool in online dating. It accomplishes three things simultaneously: confirms the person looks like their photos, gives you a sense of their personality and communication style, and weeds out catfishers who will refuse.</p>

<p>Keep the first video call short (15-20 minutes). You do not need to have a full date on video. You just need to confirm they are real, they seem normal, and you feel comfortable enough to meet in person.</p>

<p>If someone refuses a video call after a week of messaging, take it as a serious red flag. The most common excuses (broken camera, too shy, bad internet) are rarely genuine in 2026 when every smartphone has a front-facing camera and Wi-Fi is ubiquitous.</p>

<h2 id="meeting-safely">6. Meeting in Person: Safety Checklist</h2>

<p>The first in-person meeting is the highest-risk moment in online dating. Follow this checklist every time you meet someone from a dating app for the first time:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Meet in a public place.</strong> Coffee shops, restaurants, bars, parks with other people around. Never at someone's home or a private location.</li>
  <li><strong>Tell a friend.</strong> Share the name, phone number, and photos of your date with a trusted friend. Share your location in real-time using Find My Friends, Google Maps sharing, or similar apps.</li>
  <li><strong>Drive yourself or use your own ride.</strong> Do not accept a ride from your date or depend on them for transportation. Maintain your ability to leave at any time.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep your phone charged.</strong> A dead phone means no ability to call for help or order a ride. Bring a portable charger if needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Limit alcohol consumption.</strong> Stay sharp and in control, especially on a first date with someone you have never met before.</li>
  <li><strong>Watch your drink.</strong> Never leave your drink unattended. If you do, order a new one.</li>
  <li><strong>Plan an exit strategy.</strong> Have a friend on standby to call you at a specific time. If the date is going badly, you have a built-in reason to leave.</li>
  <li><strong>Trust your gut.</strong> If something feels off, leave. You do not owe anyone an explanation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sharing-info">7. When to Share Personal Information</h2>

<p>Information should be shared gradually as trust is built. Here is a general timeline:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Information</th><th>When to Share</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>First name</td><td>From the start</td></tr>
<tr><td>Phone number</td><td>After several days of messaging (use Google Voice)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Social media</td><td>After a successful first date</td></tr>
<tr><td>Last name</td><td>After meeting in person and feeling comfortable</td></tr>
<tr><td>Home address</td><td>After multiple dates and established trust</td></tr>
<tr><td>Workplace details</td><td>After you feel genuinely safe with the person</td></tr>
<tr><td>Financial information</td><td>Only in a committed relationship, if ever</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="trust-instincts">8. Trusting Your Instincts</h2>

<p>Your subconscious processes social cues faster than your conscious mind. If something feels wrong, it probably is. Do not rationalize away discomfort because you want the connection to work out. Common gut feelings that should be taken seriously include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Feeling pressured to meet before you are ready</li>
  <li>Feeling like they are hiding something</li>
  <li>Noticing controlling behavior (demanding to know where you are, who you are with)</li>
  <li>Feeling uncomfortable with how physical they are being</li>
  <li>Sensing anger beneath the surface when things do not go their way</li>
</ul>

<p>You are never obligated to continue a date, respond to messages, or give someone another chance. Your safety and comfort are non-negotiable.</p>

<h2 id="reporting">9. How to Report Bad Behavior</h2>

<p>Every dating app has reporting features. Use them. Reporting inappropriate behavior protects not just you but everyone else on the platform. Things worth reporting include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fake or stolen photos</li>
  <li>Requests for money</li>
  <li>Threatening or abusive messages</li>
  <li>Underage users</li>
  <li>Harassment after you have asked someone to stop contacting you</li>
  <li>Anyone promoting illegal activity</li>
</ul>

<p>For criminal behavior (threats, stalking, assault, fraud), file a police report. For romance scams, report to the FTC at <strong>reportfraud.ftc.gov</strong> and the FBI's IC3 at <strong>ic3.gov</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="specific-groups">10. Safety Tips for Specific Groups</h2>

<h3>Women</h3>
<p>Women are disproportionately targeted by romance scammers and face higher physical safety risks when meeting strangers. Always tell a friend where you are going, share your live location, and have a code word system where a friend can call you with a "reason to leave" if you text the code word.</p>

<h3>LGBTQ+ Users</h3>
<p>In some regions, dating app data has been used to target LGBTQ+ individuals. Use apps with strong privacy controls, be cautious about sharing your identity with strangers in areas where being LGBTQ+ is not safe, and consider using a separate email for dating apps.</p>

<h3>Older Adults</h3>
<p>Seniors are the most common targets of romance scams. If someone online claims to love you within weeks and then asks for money, it is a scam regardless of how genuine the connection feels. Talk to family or friends before sending money to anyone you have met online.</p>

<h2 id="tools">11. Safety Tools and Resources</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Google Voice:</strong> Free phone number to use instead of your personal number.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Images / TinEye:</strong> Reverse image search to verify photos.</li>
  <li><strong>Find My Friends / Google Maps sharing:</strong> Real-time location sharing with trusted contacts.</li>
  <li><strong>Noonlight (integrated in Tinder):</strong> Emergency safety feature that shares your location with emergency services.</li>
  <li><strong>Ask for Angela:</strong> Say "Is Angela here?" at participating bars and restaurants for discreet help.</li>
  <li><strong>National Domestic Violence Hotline:</strong> 1-800-799-7233</li>
  <li><strong>RAINN:</strong> 1-800-656-4673 (sexual assault hotline)</li>
</ul>
